Examples
========

This directory contains several example programs illustrating various aspects of using `python-gphoto2`.
Most of them are not intended to be complete or usable, they just show how to do one or two things.
You will probably need to experiment quite a bit, and make some changes, to get them to work with your camera(s) and do what you want to do.

Some of the examples have two versions, one with `-oo` at the end of the name.
These show the difference between the "C" interface and the more Pythonic "object oriented" interface.
I hope you will agree that the OO interface is simpler to use.
It's also more efficient.
